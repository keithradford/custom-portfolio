# portfolio v2

This is the code rpeository for my [personal portfolio](https://keithradford.github.io/portfolio/). The page is fully implemented using React as a way for me to practice using the library. This is the second version of my portfolio, which originally was a classic HTML & CSS page, in which this project borrows inpiration. 

## Structure

The branch `master` contains all of the source code for the project. The branch `gh-pages` contains the build of the project. Using the npm package `gh-pages`, the source code is automatically built and deployed.
