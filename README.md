# My Portfolio

This website is a simple React app made to serve the purpose of showing off some of the projects I've worked on. This page was one of the first projects I worked on (and first GitHub repository!) and continues to be in development as it continuously allows me to build my skills and knowledge in software development.

## Learning Experience
This project originally acted as a way for me to learn simple web development skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted something to show off while applying for internships and also was looking to showcase some projects I had been working on. The original bare-bones HTML and CSS version of the page saw a few design changes, but stayed very simple while serving the purpose of teaching myself HTML and CSS.

After some time and with additional web development skills acquired, I set out to improve the site as a whole. While learning React, I returned to this project to implement it in React to build my skills in that area. After completely removing all prior code I had written, I built the page with React using JavaScript. As I used React for other projects, I gained more experience and understanding of best-practices which had me re-write the project again, this time using TypeScript and creating a far more attractive codebase.

To build skills in web development outside of the frontend, I took on the task of constructing an API to be used for this project. This allowed me to remove any hard-coded data objects from the codebase for things like my work experience and list of projects. In turn, the codebase became a lot cleaner and I built knowledge in developing a backend, specifically a Ruby on Rails API.

A work in progress API built using Ruby on Rails. `portfolio-api` serves to allow for the easy creation and accessing of my projects, work experience, and in the future a blog!
